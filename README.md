> **User**: Hey Google / Alexa, open *Greetings from Earth*.

> **Assistant**: Welcome to *Greetings from Earth*. What is your name?

> **User**: My name is *Elon*.

> **Assistant**: And what planet are you from?

> **User**: I'm from *Mars*.

> **Assistant**: Dear *Elon*, your very personal Greetings from Earth will reach *Mars* in about 22 light-minutes.
